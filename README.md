# 📰 news-fetch

**news-fetch** is an open-source, easy-to-use news crawler that extracts structured information from almost any news website 🌐. It can recursively follow internal hyperlinks and read RSS feeds to fetch both recent and archived articles 📚. You only need to provide the root URL of the news website to crawl it completely 🔍. News-fetch combines the power of multiple state-of-the-art libraries and tools, including [news-please](https://github.com/fhamborg/news-please) by [Felix Hamborg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felixhamborg/) and [Newspaper3K](https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper/) by [Lucas (欧阳象) Ou-Yang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasouyang/). This package leverages features from both of these works 🤖.

I built this tool to minimize NaN or empty values when scraping data from various news websites 🚀. It's platform-independent and written in Python 3, making it easy for programmers and developers to access news data for their applications 💻.

## 🚀 Usage

To scrape all the news details, use the `newspaper` function:

```python
from newsfetch.news import Newspaper

news = Newspaper(url='https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/aa-plays-a-pivotal-role-in-helping-people-escape-from-the-grip-of-alcoholism/article67716206.ece')
print(news.headline)
# Output: 'AA plays a pivotal role in helping people escape from the grip of alcoholism'
```

To extract URLs from a targeted website, call the `GoogleSearchNewsURLExtractor` by providing the keyword and newspaper link as arguments:

```python
from newsfetch.google import GoogleSearchNewsURLExtractor

google = GoogleSearchNewsURLExtractor(keyword='Alcoholics Anonymous', news_domain='https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/')
print(google.urls)
